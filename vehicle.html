        <p>
          Inside our unique Exhibition trailer we have up to 24 Exhibition Stands. We invite companies to come with us to showcase their technologies on board. 
        We visit prime industry sites and meet Engineering, Production, Design and Development Teams who rarely get the chance these days to visit the more traditional trade shows.
        </p>
        <p>
       <br> Over the last 16 years we have run Industry Specific Roadshows in the Automotive, Defence & Aerospace, Rail, Medical Device Technology and Oil & Gas Industries. In 2021 we plan to run our Rail Industry Tour in March, and Defence & Aerospace Tour in September. These tours will put you on site, in front of the hard-to-reach Engineers, and deliver a unique sales and marketing opportunity.</p>  
        </p>

            </li>
            <li>•Tailor it to your own specification and design and take it wherever you want to go.</li>
            <li>
              •Showcase your technology to existing and new customers in a unique environment.
            </li>
            <li>•Use it for training, presentations, and hospitality. The options are endless.</li>

        <p>Industries that we have successfully covered in the last 16 years include Defence & Aerospace, Automotive, Rail, Oil & Gas and Medical Device Technology.

          We believe our roadshows are by far the best way to connect face to face with Engineering, Purchasing and Senior Management directly on their premises.
          <p><br>
          As one of 20 companies you will enjoy the economies of scale as our tours are very competitively priced delivering so much more than the traditional trade show.
        </p>
          
        <p> <br>
        So why not do something a bit different in 2021? Something that is unique, innovative, and exciting. Your stand is already in place, all we require is your artwork and then you can come and meet all those lovely Engineers that don’t go to trade shows anymore!</p>
